# NC Newsit

A functioning news site with articles, comments and user profiles. This reddit-like user interface consumes my NC-News API. Users can view and sort articles, see separate pages for different topics, vote on articles, and post and delete comments on individual articles.

The hosted version of this app can be found here: https://ncnewsit.netlify.app

The hosted back-end API for this app can be found here: https://hollycr-nc-news.onrender.com/api

## Getting Started

You can run a local version of this app by doing the following:

1. Make sure you have Node.js (min. v17.0.29) installed. The following instructions also assume the use of NPM (Node Package Manager) to manage our project dependencies.

2. Clone this repo locally using the command `git clone https://github.com/hollycr/nc-news`

3. Install all dependencies by navigating to the root directory `cd nc-news` and running `npm i`.

4. To then run this project locally, use the command `npm run dev`

Now you're ready! Enjoy.
